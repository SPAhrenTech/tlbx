This project gives the following error when compiling: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code
Can you fix it?

Can I tell CMake to change the names of file groups from "Source Files" and "Header Files" to "sources" and "headers"?

Please do the same for tlbx_tests.

Why is CMake adding CMakeLists.txt to the project?
